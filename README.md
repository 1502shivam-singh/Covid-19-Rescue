# Reflection

Made this catalogue web app for all Covid19 related resources online, in light of the  
devastation that is occuring in our country at the moment due to COVID19.  

Just an iota of effort from my end to extend help.  
This thing better end soon for the devastation and macabre  
it's causing and together we're pulling it through, mask up!
